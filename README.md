# installit

Installer for many shell programs from terminalforlife.

NOTE
----

This repository is NOT meant to be downloaded and used directly, but it can (and probably should be) used when you see it packaged with my other repositories.

HOW TO USE
----------

Couldn't be easier. Just download this program and this one alone, then execute it, if it has executable privileges. While this is a bit tedious in that situation, the best part of using this installer is that it's so easy to share and reuse, while also allowing for uninstalling of the program for which it was written.

Installer for many shell programs from terminalforlife.

HOW TO USE
----------

Couldn't be easier. Just download this program and this one alone, then execute it, if it has executable privileges. While this is a bit tedious in that situation, the best part of using this installer is that it's so easy to share and reuse, while also allowing for uninstalling of the program for which it was written.
